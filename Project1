# Project 1: Stock Trend Analysis Using Moving Averages

## 📌 Overview
A beginner-friendly data analysis project focused on analyzing stock price trends using Python. This project uses moving averages to identify buy/sell signals and visualize patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Objective
To analyze historical stock price data and determine simple strategies for identifying trends using:
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Yahoo Finance (e.g., TCS or Reliance)
- Data range: Last 1 year (CSV format)

## 🧠 Key Steps
1. Imported and cleaned historical stock data
2. Calculated SMA and EMA
3. Visualized stock price with overlaid moving averages
4. Simulated entry/exit points for a basic strategy

## 📌 Results
- Developed a clear understanding of how moving averages work
- Identified ideal crossover points as potential trade signals

## 🧩 Learning Outcomes
- Improved data cleaning and time-series plotting skills
- Strengthened understanding of financial indicators
